### Overview of Verilog Logic Gates Project

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to have basic digital logic circuits designed, implemented, and simulated using Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and ModelSim simulation software. A comprehensive understanding of digital logic design is aimed to be provided, including the creation of various logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and combinational circuits (such as adders and multiplexers). By the end of the project, the functionality of these circuits is to be verified through simulation and waveform analysis.

#### Key Activities
1. **Learning Verilog HDL**:
   - The syntax and semantics of Verilog are to be understood.
   - Familiarity with different Verilog constructs such as modules, ports, wires, and registers is to be developed.

2. **Designing Logic Gates**:
   - Various basic logic gates are to be implemented using Verilog:
     - AND gate
     - OR gate
     - NOT gate
     - NAND gate
     - NOR gate
     - XOR gate
     - XNOR gate

3. **Designing Combinational Circuits**:
   - More complex circuits using basic gates are to be implemented:
     - Half Adder
     - Full Adder
     - 2-to-1 Multiplexer

4. **Writing Testbenches**:
   - Testbenches for each logic gate and combinational circuit are to be developed.
   - Different input combinations are to be applied, and outputs are to be observed to verify correct functionality.

5. **Simulation in ModelSim**:
   - The Verilog code and testbenches are to be compiled.
   - Simulations using ModelSim are to be run to generate waveforms.
   - Waveforms are to be analyzed to ensure the circuits perform as expected.

6. **Verification and Debugging**:
   - The correctness of the logic gates and combinational circuits is to be verified by comparing the simulation results with expected results.
   - Any issues found during simulation are to be debugged.

#### Project Components
1. **Logic Gate Modules**:
   - Each gate is to be implemented as a separate Verilog module.
   - Example modules:
     - `myandgate`
     - `myorgate`
     - `mynotgate`
     - `mynandgate`
     - `mynnorgate`
     - `myxorgate`
     - `myxnorgate`

2. **Combinational Circuit Modules**:
   - More complex circuits using multiple logic gates are to be implemented.
   - Example modules:
     - `myhalfadder`
     - `myfulladder`
     - `my2to1mux`

3. **Testbenches**:
   - Each module is to have an associated testbench to verify its functionality.
   - Testbenches are to apply various input combinations and check outputs.
   - `$display` statements are to be used to print results to the console.
   - Waveform viewers in ModelSim are to be used for visual verification.

#### Skills and Tools Used
- **Verilog HDL**:
  - Writing of syntactically correct and efficient Verilog code is to be done.
  - An understanding of basic digital logic and combinational circuit design is to be demonstrated.

- **ModelSim**:
  - The compilation and simulation of Verilog code are to be performed.
  - Waveform viewers are to be used to analyze the behavior of digital circuits.

- **Debugging and Verification**:
  - Errors in Verilog code are to be identified and fixed.
  - The correctness of digital circuits is to be verified through simulation and comparison with expected results.

#### Project Summary
This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement digital logic circuits using Verilog HDL. The designs are validated through simulation in ModelSim to confirm the correct operation of basic logic gates and more complex combinational circuits. Hands-on experience is gained from writing testbenches and analyzing waveforms, developing a solid foundation in digital design and simulation. The importance of verification and debugging in the design process is highlighted, ensuring that the final circuits perform as intended.
